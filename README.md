SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)
JOIN in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them (usually a foreign key).

 INNER JOIN
➡ Returns only the matching rows from both tables.

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
➡ Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table.
➡ Non-matching rows from the right table show as NULL.

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
➡ Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table.
➡ Non-matching rows from the left table show as NULL.

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)
➡ Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
➡ Non-matching rows will have NULLs for missing side values.

CROSS JOIN
➡ Produces a Cartesian product — all combinations of rows from both tables.
